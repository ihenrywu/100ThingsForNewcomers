Bank Cards
==========

Top banks include RBC, CIBC, TD, BMO, and Scotiabank. They often have promotions on card openings, so research well on their websites first. With your passport and Study Permit, you can apply for a debit card, and it is best to apply for a credit card at the same time to build up your credit score in Canada.

All of these banks have branches on campus. But note that most banks do not accept walk-in to open an account, so you must make an appointment on the official website. You can do it now, based on your arrival date, so you can be the first to get a card once you've settled in. If you already have a Visa or Mastercard card from your home country, you can swipe it in most cases. In addition, for Chinese students, Alipay is accepted in many places in Vancouver.
