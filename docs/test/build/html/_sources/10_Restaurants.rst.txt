No one restaurant suits everyone's tastes so that I won't make any recommendations for restaurants, but there are a few tucked-away options to talk about.

----

Pizza
-----

Pizza is always the least bad option, and there are a number of pizzerias on campus. The closest one to Sauder, and the cheapest, is Uncle Fatih's Pizza, which is $4 for a slice and $8 for a combo.

Chinese restaurants
-------------------

Food Court is highly recommended; there are several restaurants inside, almost the most cost-effective Chinese food on campus. It's about $12 for a set meal. It's located in the basement next to McDonald's, you need to go downstairs, and it's not very easy to find.

Tim Hortons
-----------

Forget Starbucks; that's Seattle coffee. Here in Canada, we drink Tims, which can be found almost everywhere on the streets of Canada, and the most classic coffee is the “Double Double”. there is a Tims right next door to Sauder's, and many students will buy a cup of coffee there if they have a class in the morning, but it usually takes quite a long time to queue up.
