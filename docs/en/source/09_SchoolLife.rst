Coffee Chat with BCC
--------------------

It's never too early to start planning your new career. The good news is that we receive full support from the BCC (Business Career Centre). You can bring your resume and your aspirations to them, and you will receive a professional and warm response.

If you could only bookmark one site in your browser, I'd recommend reserving that spot for COOL (Career Options On-Line), managed by the BCC. You can use COOL to:

- Book one-on-one career advising and coaching appointments.
- Register for career-related workshops and employer events.
- View and apply for job postings, volunteer, and skills development opportunities specifically targeted to UBC Sauder students.
- View employer profiles - our Business Development team has direct connections to companies listed on COOL.
- Access resources like CaseCoach, LinkedIn Masterclass, Firsthand, and more!

Meeting Room Reservation
------------------------

If you're just studying alone, just find a random library, but if you're working in a group and need to discuss with your team, you need to find a meeting room.

Printing/Scanning
-----------------

There are printers in the library, you need to upload the documents you want to print to the website in advance and then swipe your student ID card in front of the printer to print. Remember to save some money on your student ID card first.

Certificate of enrollment
-------------------------

Sometimes, a certificate of enrollment is required to process some documents. You can do this on your own. Login to SSC (Student Service Centre), go to【Grades & Records】-【Proof of Enrollment Letter】

Sports

There are many choices of sports on campus, such as swimming, ice skating, football, baskball, gym, etc, and the facilities are very good. As a part of the student benefit ("tuition fee" put in another way), we can use the facilities for free or at a low price.

All the information you need can be found on the official website of `UBC Recreation <https://recreation.ubc.ca/>`_. The following are some of the sports.

Swimming
^^^^^^^^

We can use the school's swimming pool for free. The UBC Aquatic Centre is a water center built to world-class standards. You only need to make a reservation one day in advance.

Ice skating
^^^^^^^^^^^

As with the swimming pool, we can use the ice-skating rink for free. However, if you don't have your own helmet and skates, you must pay to rent them.

GYM
^^^
Unfortunately, the gym is not free, but it's not expensive either. There are some Fitness Centres you can choose from, and the price of memberships vary. You can get the detailed information on the official website.

Golf
^^^^

The closest golf course to UBC is right next, and although it's called the University Golf Club, it's not related to UBC in any way, so you can't use it for free. Having said that, it is really not expensive. For example, it costs only 5 dollars for 30 balls of golf practice, and you can get a discount on top-ups with your student ID.
