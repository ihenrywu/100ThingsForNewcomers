Baggage
=======

If you're not in Canada when you read this, you still have a chance to double-check your luggage. Technically, if you have enough budget, you only need a credit card for carry-on luggage: you can buy anything in Vancouver. But if you want to save money, it's better to use your full airline baggage allowance. Some pointers:

Suits
-----

Business students, spoiler alert: there are a few occasions during your studies where the dress code is formal. So, if you have a suit, pack it.

Bed sheet
---------

As ridiculous as it sounds, you may not believe me when I say it, but when you rent an apartment in Vancouver, the odds are high that the room has no furniture. Yes, your rent does not include a bed, couch, table and chairs in the room. This means that for your first night in Vancouver, you will either stay in a hotel, an Airbnb, or sleep on the floor.

Considering that hotel prices always peak at the beginning of the school year, it's better to sleep on the floor if you don't particularly mind. A bed sheet will make you feel not that bad. The rooms usually have carpeting, so put on a sheet and sleep for a few days until your bed from IKEA arrives.

Prohibited goods
----------------

Please read the list of "Restricted and prohibited goods" published by the Canadian Border Services Agency carefully. Generally speaking, fruits and meats are prohibited. Just because Canada is a friendly country doesn't mean fines aren't here. Don't let a ticket be the first impression you leave when you enter Canada.
