I don't expect you to use this knowledge, but if you need to, I hope you won't be in a hurry. This section does not constitute medical advice. Please consult a professional when needed.

Healthcare in Canada is a difficult topic to talk about. On the one hand, because of the excellent social welfare system, it's unlikely that you can't afford medical treatment if you have life-threatening issues. But on the other hand, the limited resources and efficiency makes the long wait a necessary part of the process.

Emergency
---------

The good news is that if it's a life-threatening medical issue, you'll be the first to receive treatment if you call 911 or go to the emergency room, which is located on campus at UBC Hospital. The bad news is that most of the time, while we feel our illness is urgent, doctors usually don't feel that way. What often happens is that you go to the emergency room and wait for hours to see a doctor. On the bright side, this means your situation isn't all that worth worrying about.

Pharmacies
----------

While there can be a wait of hours for an emergency room and weeks for a doctor's appointment, it is really easy to buy medication, and by that, I mean OTC (over-the-counter) medication. There are pharmacies all over Vancouver, in almost every supermarket. The most common is Shoppers; there is one right next to the UBC sign. You can buy OTC directly or consult a pharmacist.

Vaccines
--------

Although the pandemic is almost over, the BC government still recommends COVID-19 vaccinations. It is free. Appointment times can be scheduled on the website or by calling to make a vaccine appointment. Vaccines are available in Shoppers.

In addition, our insurance covers vaccine expenses, and it is possible to get the other vaccine at a very low price: for example, HPV (it is for both men and women).
