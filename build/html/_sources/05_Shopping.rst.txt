Shopping
========

Supermarkets
------------

Vancouver has many chain supermarkets that can satisfy your daily needs, such as Save on Foods, Safeway, Walmart, No-frills, Costco, etc. If you are looking for furniture, there are IKEA, SleepCountry, etc.

Online shopping
---------------

The most mainstream online shopping in Vancouver is still Amazon, the fastest can be the same day delivery, usually one to two days. In addition, many supermarkets mentioned above also have their own online shopping channels, and you can place an order through their Apps.

In terms of price, the cheapest is Temu, which has just started operating in Canada this year. but the disadvantages are, first, from ordering to receiving the goods, it takes about one to two weeks. Secondly, considering the price, it is recommended not to have too high expectations for the quality of the product.

One-Dollar store
----------------

Vancouver has many one-dollar stores, which can be understood as the offline version of Temu, almost the cheapest place to buy things offline. One on campus is named Dollar 'N' Plus, near McDonald's.

Second-hand
-----------

Buying second-hand is a good option if you want to get good quality stuff for less money, and it's also more environmentally friendly. "Don't lose it, reuse it". Facebook's Market is the mainstream online trading platform for second-hand, but be aware of scams. Remember “no goods no pay”.

In addition, you can join some Facebook groups, such as "UBC Buy and Sell Items," "Buy Nothing UBC Campus, Vancouver BC". The latter is a group where kindhearted UBCer gives away free second-hand, so as long as you're quick with your hands, you can save much money.
