Student card
------------

You don't have to wait until you arrive in Canada to apply. Submit the necessary photo online, and in a few days, pick it up at select places on campus, like the UBC bookstore, when you arrive at UBC. With the student ID, you can enter Sauder's meeting rooms, check out books from the library, buy goods from the vending machines, and so on.

Student Email
-------------

This is just as important as the student ID card. Many student-related benefits on and off campus at UBC require identification through student email, so try to apply as early as possible. Also, you don't have to wait until you arrive in Canada to apply.

SIN
---

Social Insurance Number is a unique identifier used by the Government of Canada to identify individuals and track their personal insurance, tax and employment records. A person has one and only one. Since our program includes an internship, you'd better apply for SIN.

Note that this is not a card, but nine numbers. Although the staff does give you a piece of paper with this number on it once it has been processed, that piece of paper is just a normal A4 sheet of paper, it is the number that is important. Please keep this number confidential and do not post it on the Internet or tell anyone other than your employer about it, except when doing related business at a bank or other government organizations.

You can get your SIN at Service Canada Centers, which are many. You can search for the one closest to you on Google. The required documents are a passport, Study Permit, documents proving your address, and possibly proof of enrollment. SIN accepts walk in, but like BCID, making an appointment in advance is highly recommended before you go. Otherwise, you may wait until the site and wonder if the time has stopped.

BCID
----

If you don't plan on getting a local driver's license, this is the only photo ID you can get from the local government while you're studying, and you can lock up your passport once you have your BCID. Basically, all the places in BC that require government-issued identification, you show your BCID, and you're good to go.

The place to apply is ICBC (Insurance Corporation of British Columbia), the office which also issues driver's license. Note that it's not the bank CIBC.

The application process is very simple, with your passport and Study Permit, go to the nearest office of ICBC and apply for it. The card will be sent to your mailbox in about 10 working days. Walk-in are accepted but usually required for a specific time slot, so it's best to make an appointment online in advance.

Driver's License
----------------

You can apply for a local driver's license if you plan to rent or buy a car. If you already have a driver's license from some countries, such as the US, you can replace it directly through some paperwork, but if you hold a passport from some other countries, such as China, you need to take a new paper and road test. If you have a previous license and a certain number of years of driving experience, you do not have to start the test from scratch.

Note that if your previous driver's license is in a language other than English, you need to find a translation agency authorized by ICBC to translate it. The cost is about $10-$30.
